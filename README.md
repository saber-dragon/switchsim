# Switch Simulator

This project implements a siwtch simulator, which can be used to test the performance of various switch scheduling algorithms. Note that many source codes of this project are directly copied from [booksim2](https://github.com/saber-dragon/switchsim.git). And we hope the schedulers implemented or will be implemented in this project can be directly used in `booksim2`.
